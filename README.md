### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

As a person working in tech I also like to play around with building things. Here is the space where I keep some of my ongoing projects, my perosnal site and otehr interesting things I am working on. Some are private and some are public depending on my mood. I hope to contribute more often in 2025. 

While you are here, feel free to reach out to me, there might be something we can work on together ;) 

Some of my things I am currently playing with:
- [ilias.pm](https://github.com/1lias/ilias-bio): My corner on the internet, not much yet, but I would like it to be a space where I collect some of my more public notes.
- [Advent of Code 2024](https://github.com/1lias/Advent-of-Code-2024): I am trying to get better at python while solving these Chrsitmas puzzles.
- [LogCake](https://github.com/1lias/LogCake): a small MacOS app for tracking time spent on tasks (I use it for my journal).
- [filmâ€”log](https://github.com/1lias/film-log): an iOS app for noting down the settings and other frame info for each analogue camera shot.
