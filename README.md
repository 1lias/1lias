# Hi there 👋  

I work in tech and enjoy building things in my spare time. This is where I share some of my ongoing projects, my personal site, and a few experiments. Some are public, others are private—it depends on where my focus is at the moment. In 2025, I hope to contribute more consistently.  

If something here catches your interest, feel free to reach out. Who knows, we might create something together.  

## Current projects  
- [**ilias.pm**](https://ilias.pm): My corner on the internet. It is still a work in progress, but I see it as a place to gather my public notes.  
- [**Advent of Code 2024**](https://github.com/1lias/Advent-of-Code-2024): Using festive puzzles to get better at Python.  
- [**LogCake**](https://github.com/1lias/LogCake): A small macOS app I use to track time spent on tasks and journaling.  
- [**film log**](https://github.com/1lias/film-log): An iOS app for tracking settings and details for analogue camera shots.
