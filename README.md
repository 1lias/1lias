### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

As a person working in tech I also like to play around with building things. Here is the space where I keep some of my ongoing projects, my perosnal site and otehr interesting things I am working on. Some are private and some are public depending on my mood. I hope to contribute more often in 2025.
